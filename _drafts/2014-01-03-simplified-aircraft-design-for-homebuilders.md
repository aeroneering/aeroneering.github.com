### Outline

* Lots of meat for a book so short covering so much ground.
* Doesn't shy away from equations but also gives good placeholder values and sample data from GA aircraft.
* Ideal use case for the book is taking a fairly rough sketch of a design and answering the questions
  "should I try to build this?" and "does this make sense?"
* Not the last book you would want to read before actually proceeding with your design, but definitely a great start.
* May be a great introduction to Raymer's other writing such as
  [Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600869114/&tag=postneo-20) which appears to be
  well regarded and well cited.
