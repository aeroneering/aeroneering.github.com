### Outline

* I enjoyed it, but it's probably not the best book out there for homebuilt new aircraft design.
* The introduction and biography was amazing: entertaining, amusing, and enlightning.
* The chapter on units was a distraction.
* The hand-drawn graphs and fiugres were sometimes a distraction but the black and white photos of the authors designs were nice.
* Overall the book is a fascinating look in to how Chris Heintz thinks.
