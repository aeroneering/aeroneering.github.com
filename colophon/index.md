### Software

This site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.  Jekyll is released under the MIT license.  This site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) using [a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages).  Posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the site is updated whenever I push [the aeroneering git repository](https://github.com/aeroneering/aeroneering.github.com) to [GitHub](http://github.com).  It is indistinguishable from magic.

### Templates

The site template uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) which is itself released under the Apache Software License 2.0.  The atom feed template was based on [HTML5-Boilerplate-Jekyll-Template](https://github.com/bobschi/HTML5-Boilerplate-Jekyll-Template) which is released in to the public domain.
