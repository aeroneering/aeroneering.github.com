This is an experiment in using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) to organize my ongoing thoughts on aerospace engineering.

### Why aeroneering?

Without really trying to, I've ended up spending a lot of my idle brain time thinking about how aircraft fly and how they might fly better, differently, or more efficiently.  I've also been thinking about areas where a computer scientist that knows a little bit about aerospace engineering might be able to do some interesting, if not ueseful work in this space.

I thought this was all idle brain activity until I read about [Project AHLLE](http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/ahlle_lift_drag.html) which seeks to explore the concepts of wing morphing and other interesting approaches at achieving high lift and low drag in certain situations.  I had been thinking just days prior about modern material design and the possibility of dropping the leading edge of a wing very similar to their study.  After this and a couple of other similar events, I realized I at least had my finger on the pulse of modern aerospace engineering, so I decided that it was time to think a little harder.

### Where to start?

I know a little bit about flying airplanes and I know a little bit about why they fly, but I felt like a little more background information was in order.  An initial WikiDive starting at the [Airfoil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil) page was quite interesting (that's a whole separate post though).  I eventually landed on [TU Delft](http://tudelft.nl/)'s [Introduction to Aerospace Engineering](http://ocw.tudelft.nl/courses/aerospace-engineering/introduction-to-aerospace-engineering-i/course-home/) course.  It is available on iTunes U and via the web as an OpenCourseware course.  I've been watching and listening to the course while cleaning and doing dishes and stuff like that.  I hope to get over to the [KU engineering library](http://www.lib.ku.edu/englib/) to borrow a copy of [Introduction to Flight by John Anderson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0073380245/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0073380245&linkCode=as2&tag=postneo-20).  It is supposed to be a solid but accessible introduction.

### About this site

I decided to organize my thoughts with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and since I hope soon to mix words and code, putting it all [up on GitHub](https://github.com/aeroneering/aeroneering.github.com) and [releasing everything as BSD](https://github.com/aeroneering/aeroneering.github.com/blob/master/LICENSE) as I go seemed to make sense.
