We watched several videos from the [Flying Machine Arena](http://www.flyingmachinearena.org/) last night.  This is a fantastic series of projects by the [Institute for Dynamic Systems and Controls](http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich.

My four year old preschooler absolutely loved the quadcopters and was amazed at what they could do. We talked about how people were teaching the robots how to do things and then they were practicing and learning, getting better each time.

The [quote of the night](https://twitter.com/mc/status/304761922010632192) came from her as well: "Those quadcopters are kind of like ballerinas!"

These smart quadcopters captured our imagination and while the problems at hand are more about controls, machine learning, coordination than basic things like aerodynamics, I think there is a lot of room for growth and discovery. One of the things I'm excited about is the reduction in price for entry-level systems.  I hope that things like the [Parrot AR Drone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) and micro quadcopters that are little more than PCBs, batteries, and rotors can get more of these things in front of curious people.

### Microquadcopters

Microquadcopters are interesting because of both their size and potential low cost.  Currently the [Syma X1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096SJU3U/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0096SJU3U&linkCode=as2&tag=postneo-20) looks like it's leading the pack at about $36 for a microquadcopter and a 2.4 ghz remote control.  This looks like a ton of quadcopter for the dollar.  It would be interesting to see if this device could be combined with a more autonomous control system like [ArduCopter](https://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/ArduCopter).  I'd also be curious what the per-unit cost of one of the Flying Machine Arena quads is and what it could be in volume.

### Quadcopters you can buy

This isn't a complete list, but it's a solid roundup.

* [Syma X1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096SJU3U/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0096SJU3U&linkCode=as2&tag=postneo-20) looks awesome but I haven't played with one yet.  It's super cheap at about $36.
* The [Parrot AR Drone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) is [about $299 at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HZLLPY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007HZLLPY&linkCode=as2&tag=postneo-20)
* [ArduCopter](https://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/Purchase) is $600-800 assembled, and $440-550 in kit form.
* [Crazyflie Nano](http://wiki.bitcraze.se/projects:crazyflie:index) is super tiny and [$150 to $173 in kit form](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/bitcraze-m-64.html)
* The [HeliMax 1SQ](http://www.helimax-rc.com/helicopters/hmxe0834-1sq/index.html) is [About $100 at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZVG3QA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B009ZVG3QA&linkCode=as2&tag=postneo-20).
