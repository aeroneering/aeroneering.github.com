We watched several videos from the [Flying Machine Arena](http://www.flyingmachinearena.org/) last night.  This is a fantastic series of projects by the [Institute for Dynamic Systems and Controls](http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich.

My four year old preschooler absolutely loved the quadcopters and was amazed at what they could do. We talked about how people were teaching the robots how to do things and then they were practicing and learning, getting better each time.

The [quote of the night](https://twitter.com/mc/status/304761922010632192) came from her as well: "Those quadcopters are kind of like ballerinas!"

These smart quadcopters captured our imagination and while the problems at hand are more about controls, machine learning, coordination than basic things like aerodynamics, I think there is a lot of room for growth and discovery. One of the things I'm excited about is the reduction in price for entry-level systems.  I hope that things like the [Parrot AR Drone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) and micro quadcopters that are little more than PCBs, batteries, and rotors can get more of these things in front of curious people.
